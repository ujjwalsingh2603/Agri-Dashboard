# 🌾 Agriculture Analytics Dashboard  
### AWS S3 • Snowflake • Power BI

This project is an **end-to-end cloud-based data analytics solution** that analyzes agricultural data to uncover insights related to **rainfall, temperature, yield, and humidity** across different years, seasons, locations, and crops.  
The goal is to support **data-driven agricultural and business decisions** using modern analytics tools.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project follows a complete analytics pipeline:
- Cloud data storage using **AWS S3**
- Data ingestion and transformation using **Snowflake**
- Interactive reporting using **Power BI**

The analysis focuses on understanding how **environmental and seasonal factors** impact crop yield and agricultural outcomes.
